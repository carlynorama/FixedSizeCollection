# Wishlist & TODOs


## TODO List & Specs
[ ] Must work well with C tuples
    [ ] coerce it to and from an equivalent tuple form using "as" ?
    [ ] looking for zeroed memory vs zero value possible?
[ ] proto get and set subscripts already done
[ ] No `append`. Makes no sense. But yes an insert on FSC with optional Element type that will look for a nil value to replace.
[ ] a safe insert that will do bounds checking
[ ] a safe accessor that will throw instead of fatal error if out of bounds
